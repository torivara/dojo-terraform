### Exercise 2: Defining Variables, Locals, and Outputs (local state)

**Objective**: Learn to declare variables, locals, and outputs.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a `variables.tf` file to declare variables.
2. Define a variable called prefix in your `variables.tf` file.
3. Define a variable called resource_group_name in your variables.tf file.
4. Define a local variable in `locals.tf` to concatenate the prefix with the resource group name.
5. Create an output in `outputs.tf` to display the full resource group name.
6. Run terraform plan to see changes.
7. Run terraform apply to output values.

- **Hint**: Explore Terraform documentation on variables, locals, and outputs.
